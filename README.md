**Problem Statement**

For helping the client Southeast Airline to enhance their quality of service, we designed
this project for researching the elements which will influence the satisfaction of their
clients. In this project, we will create meaningful segments of travellers and to study
how their ‘Likelihood to recommend’ varies within that segment with respect to the
other variables and then make several recommendations on how to increase the
number of NPS based on our data analysis.

Net Promoter Score

Southeast Airlines handed out surveys to their customers to measure how likely they
are to recommend the airline to a friend or colleague. The idea behind this is to gather
sentiment of what the customers’ experience was like. There are many implications of
using Net Promoter Score (NPS) as a measurement. NPS can be categorized by three
groups with distinctly different characteristics and impacts on customer brand
perception and churn rate. Customers who rated their likelihood to recommend from 1-6
are considered detractors, 7 and 8 are considered passive, and 9 and 10 are
considered promoters. Detractors are 1.5 times more likely to stop using a product in
comparison to promoters

Southeast Airline gathered a lot of raw data by doing survey. The data contains more
than 20 variables.
The data set given is at a ‘Flight Journey’ level .
The Explanatory variables can be classified into:
● Traveller Demographic Variables : Age , Gender etc
● Traveller Persona Variables : Price Sensitivity, Loyalty , Amount spent at airports
during travel, Frequent Flyer Tags etc.
● Air Carrier Variables : Airline partner, Airline Status etc.
● Travel Variables : Origin City, Flight Cancelled, Duration , Delay etc.
● Other Variables : Latitude, Longitude, Date time etc.
The Likelihood to Recommend is taken as our Y variable for the Analysis
